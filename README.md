# ST0256-Numerical-Analysis

The idea of this project is to test out if it is worth it to use `C++` instead of `Python` for
algorithms of some numeric methods, like finding roots of non-linear equations using
Newton-Raphson's method.

## Introduction

Why this project? the aim of this project is to be able to analyze and draw a conclusion to the 
question, is it worth spending more time programming in C ++? Or is it more profitable to do this 
type of algorithms using Python and its libraries in terms of development time and program performance?

## What we will test?

In this project we will only find roots of an equation using:

- Newton-Rapshon method.
- Bisection method.
- Secant method.
